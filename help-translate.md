# Help translate the app
**Windows 10 offers support for over 100 languages - help make this app accessible for everyone.**  

If you would like to add a new language or improve an existing translation, just download the English *Resources.resw* from Scanner\String\en, write down the SHA of the most recent commit (visible right below the "Find File" button) and make the appropriate changes. Please read the comment for each string carefully, to make sure your translations look great.  

Submit completed translations to scanner-win10@outlook.com with a meaningful subject and include the following:
- [x] language code(s) that your translations apply to, see <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/supported-languages'>this page</a> for reference
- [x] "*The translations I am submitting as part of this E-Mail may be used unconditionally and without any restrictions.*"
- [x] most recent commit when you downloaded your template Resources.resw
- [x] the name that shall be mentioned on the project's GitHub page (optional)
- [x] a link to e.g. your social media presence that shall be mentioned on the project's GitHub page (optional)
- [x] whether you would mind being contacted if new/changed strings need to be translated in the future

I will contact you as soon as possible and supply you with Microsoft Store strings and meta data that is needed to finish the translation.

Thank you â™¥
