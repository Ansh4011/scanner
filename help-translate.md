# Help translate the app
**Windows 10 offers support for over 100 languages - you can help make this app accessible for everyone.**  

This project uses <a href='https://poeditor.com/'>POEditor</a> for localization, so you don't need to be a software developer or own any special software (you will need to create an account on their website though). 

*Hint: Most strings include a comment for context to avoid mistakes due to ambiguity.*
- The first localization project is available <a href='https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=ZJO8uXBx2j'>here</a>. It contains all the strings that appear in the app.
- The second one is available <a href='https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=MBGzhmymLL'>here</a>. It contains the strings that users will see in the Microsoft Store.

Everyone can add a new language and start contributing. Once all the strings for a certain language have been translated, the new localization will be included with the next app update. The names of the contributors will also be visible inside the app - this is the name you choose during the account creation on POEditor. You can still change the name afterwards, but the names in the app are not updated on a regular basis.

**Thank you so much for your help.**
