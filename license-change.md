# License update
**Effective as of April 28, 2021.**

The contents of this repo are now licensed under the *MPL-2.0 license*, moving away from the *MIT license* that was previously in use.

This change was made in order to ensure that the open-source nature of this project persists even as the code may be used in other scenarios. The most important consequences are (no legal advice!):
- explicit prohibition of trademark use
- requirement to disclose the source code, if the software is distributed
- modified files must be released under the same license, if the software is distributed


The app stays open-source and can still be used both commercially and privately.
